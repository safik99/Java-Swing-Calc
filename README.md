# ðŸ§® Calculator Application

This is an application I have had made once as child of two years old. It calckulates. With numbers.

## Design

I wanted this to look like a calculator that you would use to calculate. Numbers.
I alsowanted to them this like some GayBoyMicroAdvanced from Tendo, so therefore it's maroon.

## Code
This project was mainly to for leanring sperience to learn Swing and its FormBuilder. Fun times, eh? I'm Canadian.
